Used cassette.step by Kai https://grabcad.com/kai-28. I adjusted Kai's design to match real world dimensions, hopefully.

There is no proper OpenSCAD model, although some parts are made using OpenSCAD before importing them into Blender. It's a complete mess that unfortunately can't be helped. Some mechanical OpenSCAD models use NopSCADlib.
