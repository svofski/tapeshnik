# Tapeshnik

Compact cassette data drive.

Project goals. Not all of them are realistic.

  * utilize an existing consumer tape mechanism with "logic control" to make a fully automatic tape drive
  * investigate the limits of what can be done with a simple compact cassette
  * implement random access to sectors
  * a usb mass storage device
  * use a stereo track for double data rate access, eventually use a 4-track head for quad data rate
  * investigate if altering motor speed to improve r/w speeds makes sense
  * investigate feasibility of reading while fast-forwarding with heads half-lifted

Eventually it's doomed to become either a dust gatherer/conversation piece or an art installation.
